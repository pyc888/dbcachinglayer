## Features
ðŸ”¹ **Generic Layer**: Designed to work with various database systems, offering a generic solution for caching and persistence.  
ðŸ”¹ **Concurrency Support**: Handles multiple concurrent requests efficiently and ensures thread safety.  
ðŸ”¹ **CRUD Operations**: Provides functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting database records.  
ðŸ”¹ **Thread-Safe**: Implements mechanisms to maintain data integrity in multi-threaded environments.  
ðŸ”¹ **Persistence Layer**: Offers a seamless way to store and retrieve data from the database.

## Usage
Using the **dbcachinglayer** module in your Go application is simple. Start by importing the module into your code:

```go
import "github.com/your-username/dbcachinglayer"
```

Next, initialize the caching layer and configure it according to your database settings:

```go
cache := dbcachinglayer.NewCache()
cache.Set("key", "value")
```

You can now perform various CRUD operations using the caching layer:

```go
// Retrieve value
value, ok := cache.Get("key")

// Update value
cache.Set("key", "new_value")

// Delete entry
cache.Delete("key")
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the documentation or examples section of this repository.

## Examples
Below is a simple example demonstrating the usage of the **dbcachinglayer** module:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/your-username/dbcachinglayer"
)

func main() {
    cache := dbcachinglayer.NewCache()
    cache.Set("name", "John Doe")

    if value, ok := cache.Get("name"); ok {
        fmt.Println("Name:", value)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Name not found in cache")
    }
}
```

This example showcases basic operations like setting a value in the cache and retrieving it later.
